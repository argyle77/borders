# World Borders [0.1]

**Legends of the Edges**

It is said that if you dig deep enough into the crust of the earth, you'll eventually find a stone so hard that it is unbreakable by conventional means.  It is also said that if, somehow, you managed to get through this layer, you may be lucky enough to gaze upon the impenetrable mantle itself.

I think its just a rumor, but I have seen the edge of the world.

At the edge of the world stands a barrier who's extent, from the depths of the earth and beyond the clouds above, belies reason; its origin a mystery.  Such a feat of engineering could not have been the result of any technology known to the world.  While it is a sight to behold, don't plan on continuing your journey beyond it.  No one has yet managed to breach its unconventional substance, at least not for any really meaningful distance.

### Minetest Mod
Tested on minetest versions 0.4.17.1 and 5.0.0-dev, using minetest_game.  If you are unfamiliar with minetest, get started at https://www.minetest.net/

To download, use either **git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/argyle77/borders.git** from your mods directory, or download the zip file from https://github.com/argyle77/borders/archive/master.zip, unzip into your mods directory (and possibly, for earlier versions of minetest, rename the unzipped directory to "borders").  
Don't forget to enable the mod for your world.

This mod is best used in new worlds, or worlds who's borders haven't been reached yet.  This mod is in alpha and has not yet been extensively tested, so use caution.  It may be best to give it a try on a test world first.  Please report any difficulties or bugs you may run across.

### Description
This mod adds two things to minetest.  

The first, you've seen before in such mods as [bedrock] and [bedrock2]. I've combined some ideas / code from these two and added some user settings.  This part of the mod adds "deepstone", which is an extremely hard rock that replaces stone near the bottom of the world.  Deepstone is, by default, unbreakable except perhaps by advanced tools, tnt, or mining lasers (see technic).  Underneath this, you'll find mantlestone, an unbreakable layer of stone that represents the lower border of the world.  Mantlestone is not unlike the bedrock you may be familiar with.

The second thing you'll find is out near the world borders, which currently exist approximately 31km from the origin.  This is a gigantic fence-like structure extending into the sky as well as the ground that will prevent further movement beyond its confines.

### Settings
There are many variables that can be set with regards to these borders.  The setbacks from the bottom and edges of the worlds are adjustable, the thickness of the mantle and the deepstone, the hardness of the deepstone, and several parameters that effect how the mantlestone is generated.  See Settings -> All / Advanced Settings -> Mods -> borders for descriptions of these.  Alternatively, see settingtypes.txt.

###Credits
This mod, especially the mantlestone bits, owes a great deal to those who created the original works on which it was based.  LICENSE.md is probably the definitive resource for these credits, but briefly:

Thank you to celeron55 (Perttu Ahola), kwolekr (Ryan Kwolek), paramat, Calinou, jn, VanessaE (Vanessa Dannenberg), and help from rubenwardy, GreenDimond, sofar, and Emerald2.

###Note
This is a work in progress.  Suggestions and complaints are welcome.  Thank you.
