### Textures
* The **borders_mantlestone.png** texture is an altered version the **bedrock_bedrock.png** texture from **Calinou's** **[bedrock]** mod. I (Argyle77) did not create the original texture, but I altered it, and it should not be mistaken for the original.
* The **borders_deepstone.png** texture is an altered combination of the **bedrock_deepstone.png** texture from **Calinou's** **[bedrock]** mod, and the **default_stone.png** texture from minetest_game's **[default]** mod.  Though substantially altered, this texture may be subject to the license terms stated in the default mod (https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/blob/master/mods/default/license.txt), and / or the **[bedrock]** mod.  If not subject to those terms, it may be considered Copyright (C) 2019 Argyle77 and is usable under the terms of the MIT license.
* The **borders_barrier1.png**, **borders_barrier2.png**, **borders_frame** textures are Copyright (C) 2019 Argyle77, and are usable under the terms of the MIT license.

___
### Models
* All models (**centered_plane.obj**, **frame_corner_full.obj**, **frame_full.obj**, **corner.obj**, 
**frame_cross_full.obj**) are Copyright (C) 2019 Argyle77 and usable under the terms of the MIT license.

___
### Sounds
* **whoosh.ogg** is from the teleport_request mod and was released under the **DO WHAT YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE (DWYWPL)**

___
Let's hope that covers it.
